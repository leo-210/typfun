# Typfun

Pronounced like "[Typhon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Typhon)", Typfun is a
basic functional programming language, and strongly typed (it's a **typ**ed
**fun**ctional langage, thus *Typfun*). Features type inference.

It is intended as a projet to build a parser and type checker by myself, and not
as a serious programming langage. Also, the compilation part is secondary, as
the focus of the project really is on the type checking part.
