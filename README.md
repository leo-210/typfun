# Typfun

Pronounced like "[Typhon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Typhon)", Typfun is a
basic functional programming language, and strongly typed (it's a **typ**ed
**fun**ctional langage, thus *Typfun*). Features type inference.

It is intended as a projet to build a parser and type inference engine by myself, and not
as a serious programming language. Also, the interpretation/compilation part is secondary, as
the focus of the project is mainly on the type checking part.

For the type checker, I could better understand how to structure my code thanks to 
[this implementation of a Hindley-Milner system](https://github.com/toroidal-code/hm-ml/).
